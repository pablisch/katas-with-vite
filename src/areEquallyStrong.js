// Call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal.

// Call two people equally strong if their strongest arms are equally strong (the strongest arm can be both the right and the left), and so are their weakest arms.

// Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilities find out if you two are equally strong.

// Example

// For yourLeft = 10, yourRight = 15, friendsLeft = 15, and friendsRight = 10, the output should be
// solution(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
// For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15, and friendsRight = 10, the output should be
// solution(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
// For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15, and friendsRight = 9, the output should be
// solution(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = false.

function solution(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) {
  return (yourLeft === friendsLeft && yourRight === friendsRight) || (yourLeft === friendsRight && yourRight === friendsLeft);
}
